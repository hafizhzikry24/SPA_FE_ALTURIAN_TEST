## Architectural Decisions
1. Vue.js for Frontend Framework:

Vue.js was selected as the frontend framework because of its simplicity, flexibility, and powerful reactivity system. It allows for smooth development of single-page applications (SPAs) and integrates seamlessly with various backend APIs.

2. TailwindCSS for Styling:

TailwindCSS was chosen for styling because of its utility-first approach. It makes it faster to build responsive and clean UIs without writing custom CSS. The ability to directly style components in the HTML using classes promotes a more streamlined development process.

3. Axios for HTTP Requests:

Axios was chosen as the HTTP client for making requests to the backend API. Axios is widely used in Vue.js applications and provides an easy way to send asynchronous requests. It also includes features like interceptors, automatic JSON data transformation, and error handling.

4. Environment Variables for Configurability:

All critical configuration data such as the API URL is stored in .env files for easy environment-specific configuration. This means the application can run in different environments (development, production) without changing the codebase, just by changing the .env file.

## Advanced Features and Optimizations Implemented
1. Optimized API Calls with Axios:

To minimize unnecessary network requests, I have implemented debouncing for search functionality. This ensures that the application only makes an API call after the user stops typing for a certain period, reducing the number of requests and improving performance.

2. Dynamic Route Generation with Vue Router:

For posts, each individual post page uses a dynamic route generated by Vue Router. The URL of each post is dynamically constructed using the post's slug to make URLs SEO-friendly and user-friendly. When a user navigates to a post's URL, the application fetches the specific post data from the backend API and renders the page dynamically without a full page reload.

Example URL: /posts/post-title instead of /posts/1, where post-title is the unique slug for each post.

3. Splash Screen for Better UX During Slow Network Conditions

To improve the user experience (UX) and provide users with clear feedback during slow network conditions, I added a splash screen. The splash screen is displayed whenever the application is loading or waiting for a response from the backend (for example, when fetching posts or user data). This feature provides a visual indication that the system is working, especially when network speed is slow or the application is waiting for a backend response.

## Assumptions, Challenges, and How They Were Overcome
Assumptions:

Backend API Stability, It was assumed that the backend API would be stable and responsive, allowing the frontend to make smooth API calls. Any issues on the backend would result in delays or errors in data retrieval, which would affect the user experience.

Challenges Faced:

1. Handling Asynchronous Data Fetching:

Challenge: Managing data fetching and the application's UI during asynchronous operations was a challenge, especially when dealing with multiple API calls (e.g., fetching posts, comments, and user data).

Solution: The use of Axios with Vue's reactivity system made it easier to manage asynchronous calls. Axios allowed me to handle the data fetching process efficiently, and by utilizing Vue's data and computed properties, I ensured that the UI remained responsive and updated correctly.

2. Slow Network Conditions:

Challenge: The application would sometimes be sluggish under slow network conditions, which negatively impacted the user experience, especially when fetching large amounts of data from the backend.

Solution: To address this, I added a splash screen that provides feedback to users when the app is loading or waiting for data. This ensures that the user is aware the app is still functioning, even when the network speed is slow, reducing frustration during loading times.

How I Overcame These Challenges:

Asynchronous Data Fetching: By leveraging Axios for API calls and Vue's reactive system, I was able to handle asynchronous data fetching cleanly. Axios provided built-in features for error handling, and Vue's reactivity ensured that the UI was updated seamlessly as data was received.

Splash Screen for Slow Networks: To provide clear feedback to users, I added a splash screen that is displayed whenever the app is waiting for a backend response. This helped to inform users that the system was working, even during slow network conditions, and improved the overall user experience.
